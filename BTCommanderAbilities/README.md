# BTCommanderAbilities
Mod for BattleTech
Simply allows your commander to learn every ability possible.

Most GUI elements won't show all of them, and the mechwarrior specialization has no names for more than 3 abilities.
(For compatibility reasons i will not chage these, but if you want to, you are free to do so.)

But in battle, all 3 active abilities (Multitarget, Sensor Lock and Coolant Vent) are shown and useable, all passive abilities are active but they don't have a button.
(Works the same way as Kamea in the later Campagn missions.)

As of version 1.1 you can change affected mechwarriors in the mod.json. Set All to true to affect all mechwarriors or add/change pilot tags. (Default is still only the Commander).
In any case, only player mechwarriors are affected, since AI doesn't levelup its mechwarriors.
